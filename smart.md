# S.M.A.R.T.

> SMART is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives, for example in project management, employee-performance management and personal development. The letters S and M usually mean specific and measurable. The other letters have meant different things to different authors, as described below. Additional letters have been added by some authors.

> SMART criteria are commonly attributed to Peter Drucker's management by objectives concept.[1] The first-known use of the term occurs in the November 1981 issue of Management Review by George T. Doran.[2] The principal advantage of SMART objectives is that they are easier to understand and to know when they have been done.
